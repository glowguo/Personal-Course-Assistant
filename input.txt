A platform is a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges 
between two or more interdependent groups, usually consumers and producers. 
In order to make these exchanges happen, platforms harness and create large, 
scalable networks of users and resources that can be accessed on demand. 
Platforms create communities and markets with network effects that allow 
users to interact and transact. The key is the network effect.
